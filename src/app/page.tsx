            party, and he just happened to be walking his dog at a park nearby.

            ninja hiding in the bushes ready for action shots. Before that her
            youngest sister stayed with us so that they could have a "sister
            day" to get their nails done and before that her other sister helped

                K: We actually had no idea exactly where and when we met until
                very recently when a friend asked us this question, ha. With
                some Facebook sleuthing, we finally learned that we met sometime
                in 2011 at a UCLA event with some friends. We didn't start
                dating until over a year later!

                C: Funny enough we consider our first date as going to church
                together. It was Ash Wednesday and I just decided to text her to
                see if she wanted to go with me to the University Catholic
                Church. She said yes and then I smoothly asked if she wanted to
                get dinner afterwards. We got some of the worst tofu nuggets
                I've ever tasted in my life. But at least my romantic charm and
                amazing sense of humor made up for it. The rest is history...

              <p className="text-center">
                K: Our friend Erica and I were hanging out at her dorm room one
                night when Carlo somehow invited himself to watch the Thai
                version of Shutter with us. If you know Carlo, he hates scary
                movies, so there was definitely an ulterior motive there lol.
                Erica is now fittingly our Maid of Honor for unknowingly having
                to put up with being our third wheel (the first of many) that
                night ;)

                C: I don't know if this is the "best foodwise" but definitely
                one of the "best memories at a really good restaurant." We ate
                at Next Restaurant, a Michelin restaurant in Chicago by Grant
                Achatz. We had no idea how many courses the meal was that Karel
                ate every course until she got too full. It was about course 7
                and I swear we were expecting dessert, yet course 8 was straight
                up steaks! Karel had 1-bite and her stomach said no more... I
                ended up eating 2 additional courses but for the both of us,
                including the 2 steaks.. lol

              <p className="text-center">
                C: She would probably say our Hawaii trip back in 2019 because
                that's when she forced me to go skydiving knowing I have had a
                huge fear of jumping out of a plane. I happened to be the very
                last person to board the tiny plane and there were no seats so
                they had me sit on the edge of the plane door with my legs
                hanging out as the plane took off! Then of course I was the
                first person to jump and I was completely terrified... She loved
                it.
                <br /> K: I loved it.

                K: Carlo and I spent a lot of time going back and forth between
                the East Coast and LA when he was living in Boston. While being
                long distance was tough, we made the most of it by traveling to
                new places during that time! My favorite would be the summer we
                went around Spain and spontaneously extended our stay at Ibiza.

                C: Living life to its fullest, moment by moment. As you can tell
                it took 10 years until we were engaged! But it's not because we
                were in doubt about each other. We've always lived our life
                together and at our pace. We've always been ready but never in a
